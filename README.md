#about 
this is basically a drawing app written in html css js having for goal to show possibilities that the HTML5 canvas gives.
it may be not complete in terms of compatibilites with mobile browsers devices, or in terms of paint tools, THIS is just
an example but you have the possibilities to adapt the base code to your purposes, there's no restriction for it.
you can edit, and even sell the final project you make from this base code. feel free and enjoy ;)
